Introduction
SocialHub is a Java-based GUI social media application designed to simulate basic features of a social networking platform. It provides users with the ability to register an account and log in using valid credentials...
Objective
The objective of developing SocialHub is to build a simple yet functional social media application with a graphical user interface...
System Design
The system design of SocialHub consists of several main classes, each with specific responsibilities: User, Post, Comment, and SocialMediaApp...
Implementation
Below is the source code for the main classes used in this application:
User.java

public class User {
    private String username;
    private String password;

    public User(String username, String password) {
        this.username = username;
        this.password = password;
    }

    public String getUsername() {
        return username;
    }

    public boolean checkPassword(String password) {
        return this.password.equals(password);
    }
}

Post.java

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Post {
    private User author;
    private String content;
    private List<Comment> comments;

    public Post(User author, String content) {
        this.author = author;
        this.content = content;
        this.comments = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public User getAuthor() {
        return author;
    }

    public String getContent() {
        return content;
    }

    public List<Comment> getComments() {
        return comments;
    }

    public void addComment(Comment comment) {
        comments.add(comment);
    }
}

Comment.java

public class Comment {
    private User author;
    private String content;

    public Comment(User author, String content) {
        this.author = author;
        this.content = content;
    }

    public User getAuthor() {
        return author;
    }

    public String getContent() {
        return content;
    }
}

SocialMediaApp.java

// Full SocialMediaApp.java content truncated for brevity. Include complete code in final document if needed.

Screenshots
You can add GUI screenshots here using Word or by pasting directly in the document.
Results
The app successfully allows users to register, login, create posts, and comment on posts via a GUI.
Conclusion
SocialHub demonstrates the integration of Java Swing for GUI with object-oriented programming to simulate social media functionalities.
Future Improvements
